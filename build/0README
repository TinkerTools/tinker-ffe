               Protocol for Building Tinker-FFE Installation Kits
               ##################################################

         In order to build a Tinker-FFE installation kit, perform the
         steps below. For steps 2 and 3, OSNAME should be replaced with
         one of "linux", "macos" or "windows".
 
         (1) Invoke "source build-setup.sh" or "source build-setup.csh"
             for bash/sh or tcsh/csh shells, respectively.

         (2) Next run "ant -f OSNAME.ant.xml >& build.log &". This will
             copy and make Tinker, FFTW, APBS and FFE, then build the
             Tinker-FFE installation packages.

         (3) To build FFE only, assuming that Tinker, FFTW and APBS are
             already compiled and present in the current directory, use
             "ant -f OSNAME-ffe-only.ant.xml" in place of step 2.
