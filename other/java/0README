                    Java JDK and JRE for Building Tinker-FFE
                    ########################################

        This directory contains Java JDK kits downloaded from Oracle in
        June 2020. The JDK kits are to be installed prior to building FFE,
        and are needed to run the ant sicript and install4j. For building
        and running the FFE, the version used is Java 8, update 251, as
        denoted by Java 1.8.0_251.

        On Linux, the jdk-8u251-linux-x64.tar.gz file should be expanded
        in the directory /usr/java, which may need to be created first.
        On MacOS, jdk-8u1251-macos-x64.dmg will install the JDK in the
        directory /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines. On Windows, the file
        jdk-8u251-windows-x64.exe will install the JDK in the directory
        C:\Program Files\Java.

        The 32-bit Windows JRE, jre-8u251-windows-i586.tar.gz, is for
        inclusion under the installation directory for Install4j 6.1.6.

        The "linux", "macos" and "windows" kits are JREs constructed by
        the "Create a JRE Bundle" option from the Install4j GUI, or the
        createbundle executable included with Install4j. On Linux, this
        is done by unpacking the gzipped tar file with the JRE, then in
        that directory run "createbundle -o <current dir> jre1.8.0_251".
