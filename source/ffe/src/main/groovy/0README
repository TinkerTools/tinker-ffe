                       Groovy-based Shell for Use with FFE
                       ###################################

        In order to build the FFE shell, run the commands in the script
        "console.make" after setting up the groovy compiler. The groovy
        distribution is in other/groovy.

        Note that the Console classes must be built and install in the
        "target" subdirectory before building the rest of FFE.
